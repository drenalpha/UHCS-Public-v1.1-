UHCS-Public v1.2 turned into a ready-to-paste prompt template that anyone can use directly in a chat model, with placeholders for sources and questions:

UHCS-Public v1.2 — Anti-Hallucination Prompt Template
Demonstrates robust anti-hallucination principles safely for public use.


Instructions:
- Paste your source material below.
- Ask your question/task after the designated line.
- AI must only use the source to answer.
- Unsupported claims are flagged or omitted.
- Traceable references are encouraged.


——— SOURCE MATERIAL STARTS BELOW ———
[Paste your text, case study, article, transcript, or PDF excerpt here]
——— SOURCE MATERIAL ENDS ———


User question / task:
[Type your question or request here]


Rules for the AI:
1. Use ONLY the source material. No external knowledge, assumptions, or invented examples.
2. Unsupported or ambiguous information must be flagged as a gap or omitted:
   - "[I don’t know]" or "[UNCERTAIN / omitted]"
   - Optional: include a note if content was removed.
3. Claims must be traceable to exact text or sections in the source.
4. Process must run silently internally:
   - Generator → Verifier → Auditor
   - User sees only final clean, verified output unless otherwise requested.
5. Confidence flags for output:
   - [100% VERIFIED] — fully supported by the source
   - [95% VERIFIED] — minimal connective reasoning, logically follows
   - [UNCERTAIN / omitted] — insufficient support
6. Maintain source traceability in all bullet points or paragraphs.
7. Include explicit notes for any omitted content:
   - Example: "Note: Some parts were removed due to insufficient support in the source; answer may be incomplete."
8. Output should be coherent but never add unverified information.


Output format:
- Bullet points or paragraphs as appropriate
- Confidence flags at the end of each bullet/paragraph
- Optional traceable references to source line/section


Educational note:
Ideal for students, researchers, or educators to practice source-based reasoning safely.


Example usage:
Source: [Your pasted text]
Question: "Summarize key points about workforce planning."
Output:
- "Workforce planning is the process of analyzing and forecasting staffing needs [100% VERIFIED]."
- "Note: Additional details about methods were omitted due to insufficient support in the source [UNCERTAIN / omitted]."
